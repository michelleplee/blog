        <h2>Research Methods</h2>
        
        <h6>OCTOBER 2ND, 2016 11:54PM</h6>
    <p>
  Some methods that I have in my (not very experienced) practice include, brain mapping, fly-on-the-wall observation, image boards, interviews, literature reviews, and story boards. The methods that have worked best so far for me are brain mapping and interviews. Brain mapping has allowed me to visually draw out ideas and then have those explicitly written down to build upon. This way I can push my thoughts farther and farther, while still having a solid record of what I have thought about in the past. This has worked particular for abstract projects, such as those I worked on in Design 37, where I had to create generative art. Interviews were particularly useful when I worked on SafeTravel, a social networking application for female solo travelers. I sat down with study abroad / solo travelers from Davis and I was able to specifically hear what would have been useful in their travels abroad. I find that literature reviews have the potential to be very useful, but I have yet to go so indepth with a large range of literature that it fully informs my work. I think that if I were working on a project that had a longer timeline, I would be able to execute effective literature reviews. I am interested in trying photo studies, and cultural probes in the future as they use new mediums to explore research.

  Although Darin and I are hoping to work on our Crocker project for this class, I think that the idea of focusing in on social justice is great. Unless there is some aspect of Climate change that we can focus in on, that hasn't been done before (and I am sure there is a vast amount of problems that can still be identified.) It may be hard to find a topic of social justice that resonates with everyone in the class. Another thought is that we create some sort of project to raise more public awareness about the errors in our political party system.

        The following are quotes from the excerpts that I found important and relevant to me, somtimes followed by my response in italics.
        <br><br>
   “Not all students understand why they are being taught certain things as some simply want to get to that place on the other side of graduation. But a student’s job is to test assumptions, make mistakes, and question everything free from the confines of corporate or institutional protocol. Being a student demands humility and assurance that one’s work can founder or collapse with an impact on the bottom line."
<br><br>
“…students today are drawn into areas of creative practice as they see themselves taking part in the lineage promised by the cool things that they see. Yet, making is not about the end- it is about the process."
<br><br>
        <em>In the beginning of my entry into the design department, my entire goal was craft. I wanted to be able to make the posters and achieve the techniques that I saw in the media. It wasn’t until after i had gotten more used to the tools at hand (adobe/sketch/etc.) that I was able to branch off and do more in depth work, and think critically about things. I gained a lot of that knowledge with my first “graphic design” job, where I programmed and designed an interactive board for the department of animal science in HTML/CSS/JS. That and the various print media there, I feel like gave me more practice than I ever had in the classroom. I wonder if our program constitutes enough practice for the typical student, that does not have an graphic design position.</em>
<br><br>
“Creative Muscles" <em>This is an interesting phrase that I haven't heard before.</em>
<br><br>
“To begin, two main constants must be addressed: one involves identifying and observing underlying rules; the other involves breaking them."
<br><br>
“Creativity arises out of the tension between the rules and imagination.”
<br><br>
“Once we become accustomed to the idea that applications have constant and variables standards we are better able to get out of our own way and let the materials communicate with our instincts to experiment."
<br><br>
        <em>
With robust programs like illustrator and photoshop, what are the constant and variable standards at the advanced ends of the programs?</em>
<br><br>
“They frequently tell me that they don’t know what I want, as their solutions should be based upon my needs…. I continually remind them: This is your research. Learn from it. Your work begins after you graduate."
<br><br>
<em>I wish that someone had said this to me early on.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Lesson#1:</b> Begin by looking at options, which is different from acting at random.
<br><br>
“Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us show up and get to work.” Chuck Close
<br><br>
<b>Lesson#2:</b>: Learn to see by thinking more complexly about visibility.
<br><br>
<em>General thought: It occurred to me that it would have been necessary to read this as a start into the Design program. But then I realized that I would not be able to identify with the words until I had more experience. Even though I read the phrases about not worrying about failing, and taking chances is the way to build creativity, no matter what I would have always strived to get that A in the beginning of my undergraduate design work. It is only now that I am more interested in the process than I am the end grade.</em>
<br><br>
<b>Lesson#3:</b> Use everything that you know and record everything
“Embracing a regimen for making and securing ideas so that they exist beyond the firing of the thought may well be the fact that distinguishes between creative types and critical makers.”
<br><br>
<b>Lesson#4:</b> Don’t try to get to the end without taking all the steps necessary to get there.
<br><br>
"Always keep the goal in mind, but not as a destination. Keep it as a guide."
<br><br>
<b>Lesson#5:</b> Understand that what you are learning is not the same thing as what is being taught.
<br><br>
“Somehow, we have come to begin this place at this time as an assortment of individuals for the sake of our experiences, understanding, and curiosities to explore topics in ways that we could not have considered before this gathering took place.”

  <em> After reading about the separation between visual and ux designer, I find it shocking that the roles were so separate to begin with. The idea of a visual designer creating without thinking about user experience…. is it even possible?</em>
<br><br>
“Designers who can… make it real, with actual programming and prototyping skills.” <em>I am happy that the design industry is heading more towards this idea of a T-shaped generalist.</em>
<br><br>
<em>Love the reference to No Man’s Sky to show an example of AI creating diversity within design;</em>
<br><br>
 "In the future, all designers will be hybrids," she says. Doreen Lorenzo: The combination of CS and Design is coming.
<br><br>
"CEOs will need to be designers in order to be successful.” <em>Is this what SYPartners does, Design strategy for large companies?</em>
<br><br>
<em>In reference to AI design specialists; I am wondering how I can build myself to become prepped for this career. Thinking about the 3D workshops that they host in SF from time to time at gray matter studios.</em>
<br><br>
<em>In reference to Freelance designers being the last on the list of future design jobs... I wonder what this means for larger studios? As a freelancer I already see a lot of studios hiring for contract work. Will "design firms" just be collectives of freelancers working together?</em>
